# The 'crazy' weather in Melbourne

##Introduction

--

- [Humidity Check](https://humiditycheck.com/comfortable-humidity-level-outside)  
the relative humidity level outside is considered comfortable between 30% and 50%.  

--

- [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-course-chapter-2)  
the relative humidity should be kept below 60 percent

--

## Questions

--

- How does relative humidity in Melbourne change throughout the measured time?

--

- When is it most uncomfortable to walk around the city (humidity below 30% or above 60%)?

---
## Data Description

```{r}
locations <- read_csv("data/locations.csv")
```

--

- The location.csv data is downloaded from [City of Melbourne- Microclimate-Sensor-locations](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Microclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4) 

--

- Contains the location and location description for each microclimate sensor device installed throughout the city.

--

## The locations of the sensor in Map

```{r sensor-location, out.height='45%', out.width='100%'}
locations$description <- paste0("Site",locations$site_id, ", ", locations$description)
  
locations %>%
      leaflet() %>%
      addMarkers(
        lng = ~longitude,
        lat = ~latitude,
        popup = ~description,
        layerId = ~site_id
      ) %>%
      addTiles()
```

## Summary of locations.csv

    .pull-left {
      float: left;

```

--

```{r loction-miss, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}

- Red lines are **five sites closer to river**: 1007, 1010, 1011, 1014, 1009.
<br>

- It is not closer to water network, more humid.

- Humidity is also **affected by many factors**: [river width](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22720611/), [topography, land cover, and surface reflectivity](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00010/full) and so on.
